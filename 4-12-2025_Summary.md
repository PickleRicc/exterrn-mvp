# ZIMMR Platform Development Summary - April 12, 2025

## Overview

Today we restructured the ZIMMR application to focus specifically on tilesmen as the primary craftsman type for the MVP. This focused approach allows us to deliver a more targeted product while maintaining the flexibility to expand to other craftsman types in the future.

## Database Changes

We implemented several database changes to support tilesmen-specific features:

1. **New Tables:**
   - `materials`: For tracking tiling materials with pricing and inventory
   - `customer_spaces`: For tracking rooms/areas that need tiling work
   - `appointment_materials`: Join table connecting appointments with materials
   - `service_types`: Reference table for tiling-specific service types

2. **Enhanced Existing Tables:**
   - Added `service_type`, `area_size_sqm`, and `material_notes` fields to the `appointments` table
   - Added `customer_space_id` to the `appointments` table to link appointments with specific rooms

3. **Default Data:**
   - Added default tiling materials (ceramic, porcelain, mosaic tiles, etc.)
   - Added default tiling service types (consultation, installation, grouting, etc.)
   - Created a test tilesman user (ID: 20) with craftsman record (ID: 16)

## New API Controllers

We created several new controllers to support tilesmen-specific features:

1. **Materials Controller** (`materialsController.js`):
   - `getAllMaterials`: List materials with optional filtering
   - `getMaterialById`: Get a single material by ID
   - `createMaterial`: Create a new material
   - `updateMaterial`: Update an existing material
   - `deleteMaterial`: Delete a material
   - `getMaterialsByCraftsmanId`: Get materials for a specific craftsman

2. **Spaces Controller** (`spacesController.js`):
   - `getAllSpaces`: List spaces with optional filtering
   - `getSpaceById`: Get a single space by ID
   - `createSpace`: Create a new customer space
   - `updateSpace`: Update an existing space
   - `deleteSpace`: Delete a space
   - `getSpacesByCustomerId`: Get spaces for a specific customer

3. **Service Types Controller** (`serviceTypesController.js`):
   - `getAllServiceTypes`: List service types with optional filtering
   - `getServiceTypeById`: Get a single service type by ID
   - `createServiceType`: Create a new service type (admin only)
   - `updateServiceType`: Update an existing service type (admin only)
   - `deleteServiceType`: Delete a service type (admin only)
   - `getServiceTypesByCategory`: Get service types for a specific category

4. **Enhanced Appointments Controller:**
   - Updated to support tiling-specific fields
   - Added `getAppointmentMaterials` and `updateAppointmentMaterials` endpoints
   - Enhanced transaction support for data integrity

## New API Routes

Added new API routes to expose the tilesmen-specific features:

1. **Materials Routes:**
   - `GET /materials`: List all materials
   - `GET /materials/:id`: Get a specific material
   - `POST /materials`: Create a new material
   - `PUT /materials/:id`: Update a material
   - `DELETE /materials/:id`: Delete a material
   - `GET /materials/craftsman/:id`: Get materials for a craftsman

2. **Spaces Routes:**
   - `GET /spaces`: List all spaces
   - `GET /spaces/:id`: Get a specific space
   - `POST /spaces`: Create a new space
   - `PUT /spaces/:id`: Update a space
   - `DELETE /spaces/:id`: Delete a space
   - `GET /spaces/customer/:id`: Get spaces for a customer

3. **Service Types Routes:**
   - `GET /service-types`: List all service types
   - `GET /service-types/:id`: Get a specific service type
   - `POST /service-types`: Create a new service type (admin only)
   - `PUT /service-types/:id`: Update a service type (admin only)
   - `DELETE /service-types/:id`: Delete a service type (admin only)
   - `GET /service-types/category/:category`: Get service types by category

4. **Enhanced Appointment Routes:**
   - `GET /appointments/:id/materials`: Get materials for an appointment
   - `PUT /appointments/:id/materials`: Update materials for an appointment

## Authentication and Testing

1. **JWT Token Generation:**
   - Created a long-lasting JWT token for the test tilesman user
   - Fixed token generation issues by ensuring the correct JWT secret was used
   - Generated a token with proper user ID (20) and craftsman ID (16)

2. **API Testing:**
   - Set up Postman testing for all new endpoints
   - Created test data for materials, spaces, and appointments
   - Verified proper authorization and data isolation

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Updates:**
   - Update the dashboard to highlight tiling-specific information
   - Create material management screens
   - Enhance appointment creation with tiling-specific fields
   - Add customer space tracking to customer profiles

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
   - Add tiling-specific calculators (material quantity, pricing)
   - Enhance appointment scheduling with default durations based on service type
   - Create tiling-specific email templates

This restructuring maintains the flexibility to support other craftsmen types in the future while providing a focused experience for tilesmen in the current MVP.
