# ZIMMR Platform Development Summary - April 12, 2025

## Overview

Today we restructured the ZIMMR application to focus specifically on tilesmen as the primary craftsman type for the MVP. This focused approach allows us to deliver a more targeted product while maintaining the flexibility to expand to other craftsman types in the future.

We've made significant improvements to the customer management features and user experience:

1. **Registration Process Improvements:**
   - Simplified the registration page to focus on craftsmen
   - Updated specialty options to include a variety of tiling specialties
   - Made the registration process more intuitive with better form validation
   - Added support for both craftsmen and customer account types

2. **Login Flow Enhancement:**
   - Modified the login process to skip unnecessary availability checks
   - Improved user experience by setting `onboardingCompleted` to true for all users
   - Fixed redirection logic to send users to the appropriate dashboard

3. **Customer Details Page:**
   - Created a new customer details page with view and edit functionality
   - Implemented a mobile-first, responsive design using Tailwind CSS

4. **Bug Fixes:**

   - Fixed import path issues for better code organization

## Database Changes

We implemented several database changes to support tilesmen-specific features:

1. **New Tables:**
   - `materials`: For tracking tiling materials with pricing and inventory
   - `customer_spaces`: For tracking rooms/areas that need tiling work
   - `appointment_materials`: Join table connecting appointments with materials
   - `service_types`: Reference table for tiling-specific service types

2. **Enhanced Existing Tables:**
   - Added `service_type`, `area_size_sqm`, and `material_notes` fields to the `appointments` table
   - Added `customer_space_id` to the `appointments` table to link appointments with specific rooms

3. **Default Data:**
   - Added default tiling materials (ceramic, porcelain, mosaic tiles, etc.)
   - Added default tiling service types (consultation, installation, grouting, etc.)
   - Created a test tilesman user (ID: 20) with craftsman record (ID: 16)

## New API Controllers

We created several new controllers to support tilesmen-specific features:

1. **Materials Controller** (`materialsController.js`):
   - `getAllMaterials`: List materials with optional filtering
   - `getMaterialById`: Get a single material by ID
   - `createMaterial`: Create a new material
   - `updateMaterial`: Update an existing material
   - `deleteMaterial`: Delete a material
   - `getMaterialsByCraftsmanId`: Get materials for a specific craftsman

2. **Spaces Controller** (`spacesController.js`):
   - `getAllSpaces`: List spaces with optional filtering
   - `getSpaceById`: Get a single space by ID
   - `createSpace`: Create a new customer space
   - `updateSpace`: Update an existing space
   - `deleteSpace`: Delete a space
   - `getSpacesByCustomerId`: Get spaces for a specific customer

3. **Service Types Controller** (`serviceTypesController.js`):
   - `getAllServiceTypes`: List service types with optional filtering
   - `getServiceTypeById`: Get a single service type by ID
   - `createServiceType`: Create a new service type (admin only)
   - `updateServiceType`: Update an existing service type (admin only)
   - `deleteServiceType`: Delete a service type (admin only)
   - `getServiceTypesByCategory`: Get service types for a specific category

4. **Enhanced Appointments Controller:**
   - Updated to support tiling-specific fields
   - Added `getAppointmentMaterials` and `updateAppointmentMaterials` endpoints
   - Enhanced transaction support for data integrity

5. **Enhanced Customer Controller:**
   - Modified `getAllCustomers` to filter by craftsman_id

   - `DELETE /materials/:id`: Delete a material
   - `GET /materials/craftsman/:id`: Get materials for a craftsman

2. **Spaces Routes:**
   - `GET /spaces`: List all spaces
   - `GET /spaces/:id`: Get a specific space
   - `POST /spaces`: Create a new space

   - Fixed appointment creation to properly store craftsman_id

5. **Enhanced Customer Routes:**

   - Added support for email and address fields
   - Improved security to ensure craftsmen can only access their own customers

## Authentication and Testing

1. **JWT Token Generation:**
   - Created a long-lasting JWT token for the test tilesman user
   - Fixed token generation issues by ensuring the correct JWT secret was used
   - Generated a token with proper user ID (20) and craftsman ID (16)
   - Updated registration to properly handle craftsman name vs. username

2. **API Testing:**
   - Set up Postman testing for all new endpoints
   - Created test data for materials, spaces, and appointments

## Next Steps

1. **Frontend Updates:**

   - Create material management screens
   - Enhance appointment creation with tiling-specific fields
   - Add customer space tracking to customer profiles

2. **User Experience Improvements:**
