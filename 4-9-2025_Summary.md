# Extern MVP - Email Notification System Implementation (April 9, 2025)

## Overview
This development session focused on implementing a comprehensive email notification system for the Extern platform, enabling automated communications between craftsmen and customers for appointment approvals, rejections, and new bookings. The implementation uses Ethereal Email for testing, allowing full verification of email functionality without sending actual emails during development.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Appointment Approval System
- Added `approval_status` field to appointments table (pending, approved, rejected)
- Implemented controller functions for approving and rejecting appointments
- Added email notifications triggered by status changes
- Updated the appointments page UI to display approval status and action buttons

### 2. Email Service Implementation
- Created a modular email service using Nodemailer
- Implemented Ethereal Email integration for testing
- Designed HTML email templates for different notification types
- Added error handling to prevent API failures if email sending fails

### 3. Test Endpoints
- Created `/test-email` endpoint to verify email configuration
- Added `/send-test-email` endpoint for testing email delivery
- Implemented preview URLs for viewing test emails in Ethereal's interface

### 4. Database Updates
- Modified SQL queries to properly join users and craftsmen tables
- Updated appointment queries to retrieve email information from the users table
- Fixed the "column cr.email does not exist" error by joining with the users table

## Technical Implementation

### Email Service Architecture
The email service was implemented with the following components:

1. **Transporter Configuration**
   - Automatic detection of development/production environment
   - Fallback to Ethereal test accounts when email credentials aren't provided
   - Proper error handling for connection issues

2. **Email Templates**
   - Appointment approval notification for customers
   - Appointment rejection notification with reason
   - New appointment notification for craftsmen

3. **Helper Functions**
   - Date and time formatting for better readability
   - Preview URL generation for test emails
   - Test email functionality

### Example Email Template
```html
<div style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;">
  <h2 style="color: #0070f3;">Appointment Confirmed</h2>
  <p>Hello ${appointment.customer_name},</p>
  <p>Your appointment with ${appointment.craftsman_name} has been confirmed for:</p>
  <div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; margin: 15px 0;">
    <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Date:</strong> ${formattedDate}</p>
    <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Time:</strong> ${formattedTime}</p>
    <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Location:</strong> ${appointment.location || 'To be determined'}</p>
    <p style="margin: 5px 0;"><strong>Duration:</strong> ${appointment.duration} minutes</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Simplified Onboarding

- Ensured returning users are directed to appointments page by default

### 2. Appointment Management
