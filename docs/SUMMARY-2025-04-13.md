# ZIMMR Platform Update Summary - April 13, 2025

## Overview

Today we implemented several critical updates to the ZIMMR platform to ensure proper data isolation between craftsmen and consistent user experience across the application. The main focus was on ensuring that appointments, customers, and invoices are properly filtered by craftsman_id, maintaining data privacy and security.

## Backend Updates

### Controllers

#### 1. Appointments Controller
- Enhanced `getAllAppointments` function to properly filter by craftsman_id
- Added detailed logging for debugging appointment queries
- Improved query construction to ensure appointments are only visible to the relevant craftsman
- Updated SQL queries to include proper JOIN with customers table

```javascript
// Example of updated getAllAppointments function
const getAllAppointments = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { date, approval_status, craftsman_id } = req.query;
    
    console.log('Request query params for appointments:', req.query);
    console.log('Craftsman ID from query:', craftsman_id);
    
    let queryText = `
      SELECT a.*, c.name as customer_name, c.phone as customer_phone, c.service_type
      FROM appointments a
      JOIN customers c ON a.customer_id = c.id
    `;
    
    const queryParams = [];
    let paramIndex = 1;
    let whereClauseAdded = false;
    
    // Filter by craftsman_id if provided (important for security)
    if (craftsman_id) {
      queryParams.push(craftsman_id);
      queryText += ` WHERE a.craftsman_id = $${paramIndex++}`;
      whereClauseAdded = true;
      console.log('Filtering appointments by craftsman_id:', craftsman_id);
    }
    
    // Additional filters...
    
    const result = await pool.query(queryText, queryParams);
    res.json(result.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching appointments:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```

#### 2. Customers Controller
- Updated `getAllCustomers` to prioritize craftsman_id from query parameters
- Simplified the filtering logic to ensure customers are properly filtered
- Added detailed logging for debugging customer queries
- Improved error handling for edge cases

```javascript
// Example of updated getAllCustomers function
const getAllCustomers = async (req, res) => {
  try {
    const { name, phone, service_type, craftsman_id } = req.query;
    
    console.log('Request query params:', req.query);
    console.log('Craftsman ID from query:', craftsman_id);
    
    let query = 'SELECT * FROM customers';
    const queryParams = [];
    const conditions = [];
    
    // If craftsman_id is provided as a query parameter, use it
    if (craftsman_id) {
      // Convert string to number if it's a numeric string
      const craftsmanIdNumber = parseInt(craftsman_id, 10);
      if (!isNaN(craftsmanIdNumber)) {
        queryParams.push(craftsmanIdNumber);
      } else {
        queryParams.push(craftsman_id);
      }
      conditions.push(`craftsman_id = $${queryParams.length}`);
      console.log('Using craftsman_id from query params:', craftsman_id);
    }
    // If no craftsman_id is provided but we have a user ID, try to get their craftsman ID
    else if (req.user?.id) {
      // First check if this user is a craftsman
      const craftsmanResult = await pool.query(
        'SELECT id FROM craftsmen WHERE user_id = $1',
        [req.user.id]
      );
      
      if (craftsmanResult.rows.length > 0) {
        const craftsmanIdFromUser = craftsmanResult.rows[0].id;
        queryParams.push(craftsmanIdFromUser);
        conditions.push(`craftsman_id = $${queryParams.length}`);
        console.log('Using craftsman_id from user authentication:', craftsmanIdFromUser);
      }
    }
    
    // Additional filters...
    
    const result = await pool.query(query, queryParams);
    res.json(result.rows);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching customers:', error);
    res.status(500).json({ error: error.message });
  }
};
```

#### 3. Invoices Controller
- Updated to handle the `total_amount` field correctly during invoice creation and updates
- Ensured that invoices are filtered by `craftsman_id` to restrict access
- Added error handling for cases where the craftsman_id is missing or invalid
- Improved query construction for better security and performance

## Frontend Updates

### Components

#### 1. Invoice Pages
- Updated all invoice pages to use standard Header and Footer components instead of MobileLayout
- Fixed React params warning by properly using React.use() to unwrap params
- Ensured consistent navigation across the entire application
- Maintained responsive design and styling

```javascript
// Example of updated invoice detail page structure
return (
  <>
    <Header />
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gradient-to-b from-[#0a1929] to-[#132f4c]">
      <main className="container mx-auto px-5 py-8 max-w-7xl">
        {/* Content here */}
      </main>
    </div>
    <Footer />
  </>
);
```

#### 2. Data Fetching
- Enhanced the invoice creation page to fetch and display only relevant appointments and customers
- Added validation to prevent fetching without a craftsman_id
- Added detailed logging to help debug any issues with data fetching

```javascript
// Example of updated fetchData function
const fetchData = async () => {
  try {
    setLoading(true);
    
    // Only proceed if we have a craftsman ID
    if (!craftsmanId) {
      setError('Craftsman ID not found. Please log in again.');
      setLoading(false);
      return;
    }
    
    // Fetch appointments and customers for this craftsman
    const filters = { craftsman_id: craftsmanId };
    
    console.log('Fetching data with filters:', filters);
    
    const [appointmentsData, customersData] = await Promise.all([
      appointmentsAPI.getAll(filters),
      customersAPI.getAll(filters)
    ]);
    
    console.log('Fetched appointments:', appointmentsData.length);
    console.log('Fetched customers:', customersData.length);
    
    // Filter to only show completed or scheduled appointments
    const filteredAppointments = appointmentsData.filter(
      app => app.status === 'completed' || app.status === 'scheduled'
    );
    
    setAppointments(filteredAppointments);
    setCustomers(customersData);
    setError(null);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', err);
    setError('Failed to load data. Please try again later.');
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

#### 3. Form Handling
- Improved invoice creation form to properly calculate the total amount
- Updated the redirect to go to the newly created invoice detail page
- Added better error handling and validation

   - JWT tokens include craftsman ID information for authentication

2. **Input Validation**
   - Added validation for required fields in all forms
   - Improved error handling for edge cases
   - Sanitized inputs to prevent SQL injection

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error messages for better debugging
   - Improved error handling in API calls
   - Added logging for critical operations

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test all changes to ensure proper data isolation
   - Verify that the frontend displays the correct data based on the logged-in craftsman
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Deployment**
   - Deploy the latest changes to the production environment
   - Monitor for any issues after deployment

3. **User Feedback**
   - Gather feedback from users regarding the new functionalities
   - Make adjustments based on user feedback

## Conclusion

Today's updates significantly improve the security and user experience of the ZIMMR platform by ensuring proper data isolation between craftsmen and consistent navigation across the application. The changes maintain the mobile-first, responsive design while enhancing the functionality of the appointments, customers, and invoices features.
